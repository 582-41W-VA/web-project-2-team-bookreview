# Proposal

## Project Summary

We would like to thank LTR-Love To Read, for reaching out to us with this proposal. We are very excited to tackle such a project and we must admit, we’re nerds who Grock all genres of sci-fi and fantasy. This project is tailor-made for us.

Let’s get down to the bowels of our proposal. Our web project aims to address the evolving needs of LTR by providing a dynamic online platform that fosters literary exploration, community interaction, and member engagement within the science fiction and fantasy genres.

## Stakeholders

- **Design Team:** Aysegul Aksu, Shima Deljavan Farshi
- **Development Team:** Fransiskus Aldo, Haitham Ahmed Barakat
- **LTR Management:** The owner of LTR, Partners of LTR, LTR Communication and Marketing Coordinator, and key decision-makers within the organization.
- **End Users:**
    
    Members of LTR and the broader community LTR readers.
    
    
    Informed by the information provided by LTR Communication and Marketing Coordinator, as well as publishing industry reports and North America book readership reports, we have gained valuable insights into the composition and preferences of LTR's audience.
    
     Our analysis indicates that the biggest readership group, characterized by their common interests, comprises enthusiasts of science fiction, fantasy, and magical realism. This group represents Group 1. Following closely behind is another significant group interested in classic and historical literature, identified as Group 2. Understanding the distinct characteristics and interests of these reader groups is integral to the success of the proposed project.
    

Including LTR management and key decision-makers within the stakeholder list ensures that all relevant parties involved in the decision-making process are accounted for and considered throughout the project.
