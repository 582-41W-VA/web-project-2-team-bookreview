- Cultivate a vibrant online community that fosters a sense of belonging, encourages exploration, and celebrates the richness of literature.

## Scope of Work

The scope of this project encompasses the design and development of a comprehensive web application tailored to LTR's specific requirements, including:

- Digital branding.
