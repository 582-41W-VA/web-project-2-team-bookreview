In light of the challenges faced by LTR following the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly apparent that embracing digital solutions is essential for sustained growth and adaptation. The limitations on in-person gatherings have underscored the importance of establishing a robust online presence to reach and engage with your audience effectively.

- Empower administrators with intuitive tools for content management, user moderation, and performance analysis to drive informed decision-making.
- Cultivate a vibrant online community that fosters a sense of belonging, encourages exploration, and celebrates the richness of literature.

## Scope of Work

The scope of this project encompasses the design and development of a comprehensive web application tailored to LTR's specific requirements, including:

- Digital branding.
- User registration and authentication system.
- Advanced search, filtering, and sorting functionalities for books by author and title.
- Member/User specific features such as submitting reviews, adding books to the personal space, and participating in discussions with comments.
